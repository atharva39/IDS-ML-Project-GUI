# Intrusion Detection System with Streamlit  

I developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) application using Streamlit, following the creation of a Jupyter notebook for initial analysis and model training. The Streamlit app allows users to upload datasets, train various machine learning models, and visualize performance metrics, all in an interactive interface.
